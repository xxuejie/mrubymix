mrubymix: a mruby source code preprocessor using Rails asset pipeline-like syntax.

Usage:
  mrubymix [source file name] [destination file name]

Syntax:
  You can add following lines in your source code(treated as comments by Ruby):

  #= require aaa
  Replace this line with the content of aaa.rb in the same directory as this file.

  #= require ./foo/bar
  Replace this line with the content of ./foo/bar relative to current file's path.

  Note for the same file will only appear in the destination file once(at the first
  occurrence location).
